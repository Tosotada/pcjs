     * for 256Kb, 512Kb or 640Kb of conventional memory, starting at address 0x00000000, with the
     * remainder (768Kb, 512Kb, or 384Kb) accessible only at an address just below 0x01000000.  In PCx86,
     * this second chunk of RAM must be separately allocated, with an ID of "ramCPQ".
     *
     * The typical configuration was 640Kb of conventional memory, leaving 384Kb accessible at 0x00FA0000.
     * Presumably, the other configurations (256Kb and 512Kb) would leave 768Kb and 512Kb accessible at
     * 0x00F40000 and 0x00F80000, respectively.
     *
     * The DeskPro 386 also contained two memory-mapped registers at 0x80C00000.  The first is a write-only
     * mapping register that provides the ability to map the 128Kb at 0x00FE0000 to 0x000E0000, replacing
     * any ROMs in the range 0x000E0000-0x000FFFFF, and optionally write-protecting that 128Kb; internally,
     * this register corresponds to wMappings.
     *
     * The second register is a read-only diagnostics register that indicates jumper configuration and
     * parity errors; internally, this register corresponds to wSettings.
     *
     * To emulate the memory-mapped registers at 0x80C00000, the RAM component allocates a block at that
     * address using this custom controller once it sees an allocation for "ramCPQ".
     *
     * Later, when the addressability of "ramCPQ" memory is altered, we record the blocks in all the
     * memory slots spanning 0x000E0000-0x000FFFFF, and then update those slots with the blocks from
     * 0x00FE0000-0x00FFFFFF.  Note that only the top 128Kb of "ramCPQ" addressability is affected; the
     * rest of that memory, ranging anywhere from 256Kb to 640Kb, remains addressable at its original
     * location.  COMPAQ's CEMM and VDISK utilities were generally the only software able to access that
